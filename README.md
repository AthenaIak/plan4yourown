Install xampp to run your apache and mysql servers.

At location [xampp installation path]\xampp\htdocs create a new folder called "Plan4YourOwn"

Copy there everything (the database folder "db" is not required, and the NetBeans folder "nbproject" is not need but useful if you use NetBeans for development)

Run your apache/mysql server using xampp and go to localhost/phpmyadmin using your browser. Import the database file 127_0_0_1.sql .

Some paths many need to be fixed but generally this is the way to get it running.
