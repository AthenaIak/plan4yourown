Install xampp to run your apache and mysql servers.
At location [xampp installation path]\xampp\htdocs create a new folder called "Plan4YourOwn"
Copy there everything (the database folder "db" is not required)
Run your apache/mysql server using xampp and go to localhost/phpmyadmin using your browser. Import the database file 127_0_0_1.sql .
Some paths many need to be fixed but generally this is the way to get it running.
